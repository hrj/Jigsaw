## Jigsaw
This is a simple Jigsaw game that fetches photos from Flickr (with the appropriate license) and generates jigsaw pieces. It was made for the 10k Apart contest.

The gameplay is intentionaly simple because the images are random, and are not tailored for Jigsaws.

The games uses SVGs instead of the typically used HTML Canvas.

## Demo
You can play the game [here][1].
